## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

### 🔐 User Management
Handles registration, login, profile updates, and role-based access (host vs guest).

### 🏠 Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with images, location, and pricing.

### 📅 Booking System
Enables users to book available properties with start/end dates, availability checks, and calendar integration.

### 💳 Payment Processing

### 🗣️ Review System
Allows users to leave ratings and comments on properties they’ve stayed in, fostering community trust.

---

## 🔐 API Security

### Key Measures:
- **Authentication**: Secure login using JWT or token-based authentication.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (e.g., only hosts can list properties).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of public APIs.
- **Input Validation**: Protects against SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures encrypted communication over the network.

### Importance:
- **Protect user data** such as emails, passwords, and payment info.
- **Prevent unauthorized access** to host-only or guest-only features.
- **Secure transactions** during booking and payment processes.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices that allow teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably using automation.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate build, test, and deployment steps.
- **Docker**: Create reproducible containers for development and production environments.
- **PostgreSQL Service**: For database tests in CI workflows.

### Benefits:
- Immediate feedback on code changes
- Fewer bugs and deployment issues
- Faster development lifecycle

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### 🖼️ Frontend
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Base technologies for web UI.
- **React (or similar)** – Component-based architecture for scalable UIs.
- **Figma** – UI/UX design mockups and layout references.

### 🧠 Backend
- **Django** – Python web framework to build RESTful APIs and server logic.
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database to manage and query data.
- **GraphQL** – (Optional) Efficient data querying alternative to REST.
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent development and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions** – Automating testing, building, and deployment.

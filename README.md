## 🎯 Project Goals
- Understand and apply key software engineering principles
- Learn and implement object-oriented programming in Python
- Build a scalable and modular backend system
- Practice using version control with Git and GitHub
- Gain experience in full-stack web development (later phases)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language for backend logic
- **Flask**: (In future phases) Lightweight web framework
- **MySQL**: (Future) Database for storing application data
- **HTML/CSS**: (Later) Frontend structure and design
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
